Some parts are snipped. Thank you for understanding :)

Most of the modules (except aimbot, esp and the ui library) you see are also embedded inside the main.lua file (as of the last version).

The files in the server folder are outdated because I didn't have the latest version saved, it was on the VPS which I don't have access to.

Fun fact: I abandoned this project on my birthday.
